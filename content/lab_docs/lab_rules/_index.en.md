1.  **Safety** -- The principal investigator of the study and his/her designated users are responsible to make sure the laboratory is a safe environment. Please review your experimental protocol and make sure it is approved by your PI. Never leave a participant alone in the laboratory.

2.  **Courtesy** -- Do not remove any equipment or cables from the laboratory that do not belong to you. Return any equipment changes to their original state (e.g., moving monitors or chairs, etc.). Do not leave used equipment in the rooms (e.g., cables or monitors), as they can cause artifacts (e.g., with EEG) and accidents.

3.  **Cleanliness** -- Keep the laboratory clean (ex: throw away garbage). Pick up any loose cables or equipment (return to where you found them) when you are finished using them. Keep the shelves organized and neat. When you are finished with your experiment, the laboratory suite should look like you were never there.

4.  **Do not go over your allotted time** -- The rooms should be turned over to the next user group at the beginning of their session. This means you should leave time at the end of your slot to remove your participant and tidy the areas you used for the next user. Even if you get started late, your session must end on time.

5.  **Food and drinks** -- No Food is allowed in the laboratory, unless they are dry snacks provided to the study participants or if this will be part of your experimental protocol. Hot food is never allowed because it is smelly and the laboratory is an enclosed space! Drinks are okay only if they are covered containers!

6.  **Responsibilities** -- As well as what is mentioned above, responsibilities also include filling out the log book, backing up your data such that it is not stored on the computers in the laboratory. Please report any issues or broken equipment to the principal investigator right away.
